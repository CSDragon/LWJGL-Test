# This is a Scratchpad.
# If you're here from my Resume, I'd prefer you not look at this code.
I can't do private repos, since that requires GitHub Prime or whatever, so there's no way to outright hide this from you, but this is a scratchpad project. Insuch, comments are at a minimum. There are no javadocs. This is bad code in every way shape and form. But that's what scratchpad code should be. So yeah, this does not reflect my abilities as a programmer.
